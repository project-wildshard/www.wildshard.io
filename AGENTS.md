AGENTS.md

 - Agents/claude/cursor never edits AGENTS.md / README.md that's humans only
 - Every request for work from Jake -> src/scripts/ask-new.sh "<his words>", rules in docs/tasks/asks/README.md
 - Follow-up work is a row in a live plan, never a new ask.

Git hygiene

 - Small Commit early & often.
 - main branch only, no worktrees, no branches, multiple agents main branch only.
 - Use pre-commit & pre-push git hooks for keeping checks/quality/lints etc.
 - Push often after every commit.
 - Every meaningful commit writes a journal into project/journal, the why & informal.

Shared checkout

 - Many agents work here, git add only for new files, use git commit -- <filespec>
 - Never git add -A / . / -u, never git commit -a, never bare git commit.
 - Never stash, checkout, restore or delete what you didn't author.

Githooks

 - pnpm install will install the hooks.

Docs / Repo shape

 - docs/ is living: edit in place, keep it true. See docs/plans for all the plans.
 - project/ is for history. See project/archive for the archives.
 - Code in ./src/ etc.
 - Top level directory is thin & lean.
 - Dev commands, layout, code rules in docs/dev.md
 - Scratch goes in ./tmp/<task>; delete it when done.

Code rules

 - In the test suite, No LLM, no claude, no herdr.
 - Every Chromium launch passes `--use-mock-keychain` and `--password-store=basic` (else a macOS keychain dialog opens).
